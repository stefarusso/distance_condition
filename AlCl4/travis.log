    Opening position trajectory ../../gro_traj/traj.gro ...

    Trajectory contains approximately 2030 frames (just a *guess* from the file size of 2.49 GiB).

    Digits or special characters in element labels not allowed.
    Removing those characters from all atom labels.

    29228 atoms in the system: 2386x Al, 5228x C, 7158x Cl, 1230x F, 8612x H, 3076x N, 1538x O

    System extent:  X = { -10000 .. +10001 pm }, dX = 20001 pm
      (in step 1)   Y = { -10003 .. +10000 pm }, dY = 20003 pm
                    Z = { -10000 .. +10010 pm }, dZ = 20010 pm

    The "advanced mode" offers seldomly required features, including support for non-orthorhombic
    simulation cells, NPT ensemble, non-periodic systems, user-definded virtual atoms, pseudomolecules, ...

    Use the advanced mode until the analysis selection menu (y/n)? [no] <RETURN>
